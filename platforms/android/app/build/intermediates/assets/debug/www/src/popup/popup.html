	Some notes:
			* gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
			* https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
			* Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
					* Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
